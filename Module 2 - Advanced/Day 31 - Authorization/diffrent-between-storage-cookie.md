# Local Storage vs. Cookies

## Key Differences

### Local Storage

1. **Storage Capacity**:

   - **Local Storage**: Can store up to 5-10MB of data per origin (depending on the browser).

2. **Data Expiry**:

   - **Local Storage**: Data persists until explicitly deleted by the user or through code. It does not have an expiration date.

3. **Accessibility**:

   - **Local Storage**: Accessible only through JavaScript. It is not automatically sent with HTTP requests.

4. **Security**:

   - **Local Storage**: More secure against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks since it is not sent with every HTTP request. However, it is still vulnerable to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks if the site is compromised.

5. **Use Case**:
   - **Local Storage**: Best suited for storing data that needs to be accessed frequently by JavaScript but not necessarily sent to the server with every request, such as user preferences, settings, or application state.

### Cookies

1. **Storage Capacity**:

   - **Cookies**: Typically limited to 4KB of data per cookie.

2. **Data Expiry**:

   - **Cookies**: Can be set with an expiration date. Cookies without an expiration date expire when the browser is closed (session cookies).

3. **Accessibility**:

   - **Cookies**: Accessible both through JavaScript and automatically sent with every HTTP request to the server. This is useful for maintaining session state.

4. **Security**:

   - **Cookies**: Can be more secure if used correctly. HTTP-only cookies cannot be accessed via JavaScript, reducing the risk of XSS attacks. Secure cookies are only sent over HTTPS.

5. **Use Case**:
   - **Cookies**: Best suited for storing data that needs to be sent to the server with every request, such as session identifiers, authentication tokens, or tracking data.

| **Data Expiry**            | Persistent until explicitly deleted                             | Can be set with an expiration date                                                 |
| **Accessibility**          | JavaScript only                                                 | JavaScript and automatically sent with HTTP requests                               |
| **Security**               | Vulnerable to XSS, not sent with requests                       | Vulnerable to XSS, HTTP-only and Secure options mitigate risks, sent with requests |
| **Transmission to Server** | No                                                              | Yes, sent with every HTTP request                                                  |
| **Ease of Use**            | Simple API (`localStorage.getItem()`, `localStorage.setItem()`) | Requires setting attributes (`document.cookie`)                                    |
| **Use Cases**              | Storing non-sensitive data like user preferences, app state     | Storing session identifiers, authentication tokens, user tracking data             |

## Pros and Cons

| **Criteria** | **Local Storage**                                                                                            | **Cookies**                                                                                     |

| **Pros**     | - Larger storage capacity (5-10MB)                                                                           | - Can be set to expire automatically                                                            |
|              | - Simple API for storing and retrieving data (`localStorage.getItem()`, `localStorage.setItem()`)            | - Automatically sent with every HTTP request                                                    |
|              | - Not sent with every HTTP request, reducing the risk of CSRF attacks                                        | - Can be HTTP-only and secure to reduce XSS attacks                                             |
| **Cons**     | - Vulnerable to XSS attacks                                                                                  | - Limited storage capacity (4KB per cookie)                                                     |
|              | - Data persists until explicitly deleted, which might not be desirable for all use cases                     | - Requires careful management of attributes (`document.cookie`)                                 |
|              | - Not suitable for data that needs to be sent to the server with every request (e.g., authentication tokens) | - Sent with every HTTP request, which can increase the size of requests and expose data to CSRF |
