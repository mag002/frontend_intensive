# Functional Components
## Props
- Passing to the component just like HTML attributes (key=value inside of open tag)
- To read the props inside of that component, use the 'props' parameter when create a component (as a first parameter)
- All of the props will be store in a 'props' object as "key: value"
- online key without value ~ value is true
- if the value is string, you can pass it without {} (dynamic value block)
